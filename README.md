# DiscordWebhook

Discord Webhook lightweight library for PHP

Language: [English](README.md), [Polski](README.pl.md)

> Feel free to extend the library:
> Discord Webhook Documentation: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#execute-webhook

## Requirements

Software you need to have installed before you can use this project:

**Local or dedicated server:**

They work almost the same way.

- [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/) — v3 or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org)

Then you need the right PHP version. Below v7 won't work.

- PHP — version 7+

## Installation

Download or clone the repository. Place the project in your server folder — folder `www` for WAMP server and folder `http` for XAMPP server (when not changed).

## Examples

> I created many examples to show you how you can use this library. I'm sure that everyone will find something for yourself.

Open your browser and type:

`http://localhost/DiscordWebhook/examples/send-message`

or

`http://localhost:80/DiscordWebhook/examples/send-message`

- `localhost:80` — host and the port that your server is listening on; it can be changed in server configuration
- `DiscordWebhook` — folder with the project
- `examples` — folder with all examples
- `send-message` — example folder; you can change the name of the folder and modify the URL
